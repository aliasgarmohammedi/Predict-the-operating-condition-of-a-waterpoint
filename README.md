# Predict-the-operating-condition-of-a-waterpoint

### Problem Description - 

Can we predict which water pumps are faulty?
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can we predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? 
Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables that include a description of the type of pump, the date when the pump was installed, the physical location of the pump, the quality of the water provided by the pump, and a description of how the pump is managed.

### Benefits of Correct Prediction -

Why will predicting the pump status help?
A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

### Data Source - 

The data for this project was sourced from the DrivenData.org website that hosts the data challenge.
